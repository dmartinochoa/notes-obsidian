## Domain 1: Detection

  

### AWS Security Hub

* **Function:** Centralized dashboard for security alerts (findings) and compliance checks.

* **ASFF (AWS Security Finding Format):** Standard format for aggregating findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, etc.

* **Cross-Region Aggregation:** Must be enabled explicitly to view findings from multiple regions in a single "Master" region.

  

### Amazon GuardDuty

* **Type:** Threat detection service (Intelligent Detection).

* **Data Sources:** CloudTrail (Management + Data Events), VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs, EKS Audit Logs.

* **Key Finding Types:**

    * `CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B` (Mining)

    * `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration` (Instance role creds used outside EC2)

* **Trusted IP Lists:** Prevent false positives from known scanners (white-listing).

* **Threat IP Lists:** Alert on communication with known bad IPs (black-listing).

  

### Amazon Inspector

* **Function:** Automated vulnerability management.

* **Scanning:**

    * **EC2:** Scans for CVEs and Network Reachability (requires SSM Agent).

    * **ECR:** Scans container images for vulnerabilities upon push or continuous.

    * **Lambda:** Scans function code + layers.

* **Deep Inspection:** Inspector can now scan EC2 paths for vulnerabilities, not just OS packages.

  

### AWS Config

* **Function:** Resource inventory, configuration history, and compliance auditing.

* **Managed Rules:** Pre-built rules (e.g., `s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only`).

* **Remediation:** Can trigger SSM Automation documents to auto-fix non-compliant resources.

    * *Example:* If a Security Group allows port 22 to 0.0.0.0/0 -> Config triggers SSM to remove the rule.

## Domain 2: Incident Response

  

### Incident Response Lifecycle

1.  **Preparation:** Runbooks, access pre-provisioning.

2.  **Detection & Analysis:** GuardDuty, CloudWatch Alarms.

3.  **Containment:** Isolate EC2 (SG with no rules), Deny IAM policies.

4.  **Eradication:** Delete root cause, patch.

5.  **Recovery:** Restore from backup.

6.  **Post-Incident Activity:** Lessons learned.

  

### Compromised EC2 Instance (Isolation Steps)

**Order matters:**

1.  **Capture Metadata:** Snapshot the volume (forensics).

2.  **Isolate:** Change Security Group to allow NO inbound/outbound traffic.

    * *Note:* Do **not** stop/terminate immediately if you need memory dump.

3.  **Tag:** Mark as "Compromised" / "Do Not Delete".

4.  **Investigate:** Attach snapshot to a forensic instance in an isolated VPC.

  

### Compromised IAM Credentials

1.  **Identify:** CloudTrail logs showing strange API calls.

2.  **Contain:**

    * Attach `AWSRevokeOlderSessions` (Deny all actions before current timestamp).

    * Deactivate Access Keys.

    * Change Password.

3.  **Remediate:** Rotate keys, enable MFA.

  

### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

* **Runbooks:** Automate incident response actions.

* **Session Manager:** Secure shell access to EC2 without opening port 22/3389 (Audited via CloudTrail/S3).

  

---

  

## Domain 3: Infrastructure Security

  

### Network Edge Defense

* **WAF (Web Application Firewall):**

    * Layer 7 protection (SQL injection, XSS).

    * Attaches to: CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, AppSync.

    * **Web ACLs:** Rules (Rate-based, Managed Rule Groups).

* **AWS Shield:**

    * **Standard:** Free, L3/L4 DDoS protection.

    * **Advanced:** Paid, L7 protection, access to DRT (DDoS Response Team), Cost Protection (refunds bill spikes from DDoS).

* **Network Firewall:**

    * VPC-level firewall. Supports **Suricata** rules (IPS/IDS), Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Domain filtering (SNI).

  

### VPC Security

* **Security Groups (SG):** Stateful (Return traffic allowed automatically). Instance level.

* **NACLs:** Stateless (Must allow return traffic). Subnet level. Good for blocking specific IPs.

* **VPC Endpoints:**

    * **Gateway:** S3 and DynamoDB only. Route table entry needed. Free.

    * **Interface (PrivateLink):** All other services. Uses ENI in subnet. Paid. Keeps traffic on AWS backbone.

  

### CloudFront Security

* **OAC (Origin Access Control):** Replaces OAI. Best way to restrict S3 access so *only* CloudFront can read files.

* **Geo-restriction:** Whitelist/blacklist countries at the edge.

* **Field-Level Encryption:** Encrypt specific form fields (e.g., credit card) at edge before sending to origin.

## Domain 4: Identity & Access Management

  

### Policy Evaluation Logic (Crucial)

AWS evaluates policies in this order:

1.  **Explicit Deny:** If ANY policy says "Deny", it is a final DENY.

2.  **Organizations SCPs:** Acts as a filter (Limit max permissions).

3.  **Resource-based Policies (e.g., S3 Bucket Policy):** Checked.

4.  **Identity-based Policies (IAM User/Role):** Checked.

5.  **Permissions Boundaries:** Acts as a filter (Limit max permissions).

6.  **Session Policies:** Passed when assuming a role.

7.  **Implicit Deny:** If nothing says "Allow", it is DENIED.

  

### Cross-Account Access

* **The "Confused Deputy" Problem:**

    * **Solution:** Use `sts:ExternalId` in the Trust Policy when a 3rd party assumes a role in your account.

* **Role Assumption:**

    * Account A (Dev) needs access to Account B (Prod).

    * Account B creates Role with Trust Policy allowing Account A.

    * Account A grants User permission to `sts:AssumeRole`.

  

### IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO)

* Centralized access for multiple AWS accounts.

* Integrates with Active Directory, Okta, Ping (SAML 2.0).

* **Permission Sets:** Defines what users can do in assigned accounts.

## Domain 5: Data Protection

  

### KMS (Key Management Service)

* **Symmetric (AES-256):** One key for encrypt/decrypt. Used by AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS).

* **Asymmetric (RSA/ECC):** Public (encrypt) / Private (decrypt). Used for signing or use outside AWS.

* **Key Policies:** The *primary* way to control access to a KMS key. IAM policies alone are not enough if the Key Policy doesn't allow IAM.

* **Key Rotation:**

    * **AWS Managed:** Auto-rotates every 1 year (cannot delete).

    * **Customer Managed (CMK):** Optional auto-rotate every 1 year.

    * **Imported Key Material:** NO auto-rotation. You must manually rotate.

  

### S3 Security

* **Bucket Policy:** Resource-based. Good for "Force SSL", "Deny Upload if unencrypted", "Cross-account access".

* **Object Lock:** WORM (Write Once Read Many).

    * *Governance Mode:* Can be bypassed with special permission.

    * *Compliance Mode:* CANNOT be bypassed (even by root) until retention period ends.

* **Glacier Vault Lock:** Enforce compliance on archives (once locked, policy is immutable).

  

### Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store

* **Secrets Manager:** Auto-rotation of credentials (RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB). Paid.

* **Systems Manager Parameter Store:** Store strings/passwords. No native auto-rotation (requires custom Lambda). Free (mostly).

  

### Data Masking

* **Macie:** Discovers sensitive data (PII, Credit Cards) in S3 using ML.

* **CloudWatch Logs Data Protection:** Mask sensitive data (email, SSN) *as it is ingested* into CloudWatch logs.

## Domain 6: Security Foundations & Governance

  

### AWS Organizations

* **SCPs (Service Control Policies):**

    * Apply to OU or Root.

    * **Cannot** grant permissions; only **Restrict** them.

    * *Example:* Deny `ec2:RunInstances` in `us-east-1` region.

    * Root user in member account is affected by SCPs.

  

### AWS Artifact

* Portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports (SOC2, PCI-DSS, ISO).

* Use this when an auditor asks for "AWS's security certification".

## ⚡ SCS-C03 New Topics

  

### Generative AI Security

* **OWASP Top 10 for LLM:** Understand prompt injection, data leakage, and training data poisoning.

* **Bedrock Security:** Use **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock** to filter harmful content and PII in prompts/responses.

* **Audit:** Log Bedrock API calls via CloudTrail.

  

### OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework)

* Standard open-source schema for security logs.

* **Security Hub** and **Amazon Security Lake** use OCSF to normalize data from various sources (AWS + 3rd party) to make querying easier.

  

### EKS & Container Security

* **Pod Identity:** New preferred way to give IAM permissions to Pods (replaces IRSA - IAM Roles for Service Accounts).

* **Runtime Security:** GuardDuty now supports EKS Runtime Monitoring.
