### **Recap and next steps**

This module gave you a practical understanding of AWS compute services, so you can choose the right tools for your applications. You learned when to use fully managed options like Lambda or Fargate, and when full control with Amazon EC2 made sense. You explored how containers solve deployment consistency issues and how AWS services, like Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, simplify managing and scaling containerized applications. You also discovered services like Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Batch, Lightsail, and Outposts, and how each supported specific use cases, from basic web hosting to large-scale batch processing or hybrid cloud environments.
